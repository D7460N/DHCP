# Client Summary Dashboard

This summary is designed for client-side project managers, product owners, and
account stakeholders responsible for tracking the status, reusability, and risk
posture of technical solutions.

## Project Health (Status Indicators)

| Area            | Status      | Notes                                        |

## Architecture Snapshot

- HTML: fully semantic, screen reader compatible
- CSS: layered and scoped with `@layer`, `:has()`, and container queries
- JS: used only for data fetch (`fetch()`), not behavior
- No framework, build system, or client runtime required

## Reuse Potential

- The architecture can be cloned into:
  - Internal admin dashboards
  - Public-facing content portals
  - Low-vision or simplified interfaces
- Requires no additional licenses, no installation
- Deployment-friendly via GitHub Pages, Cloudflare, or internal hosting
