# D7460N Customer Overview: Architecture at a Glance

This document is for non-technical decision-makers, product owners, and business stakeholders who need to understand what the D7460N architecture offers in terms of value, cost control, and future readiness.

---

## What It Is

D7460N is a front-end web architecture designed to reduce project complexity, cost, and delivery time — while improving accessibility, security, and performance.

- It uses only native browser features — no frameworks, no runtime dependencies
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (data-only, no scripting for UI)
- Designed for government, accessibility, and security requirements from the ground up

## Why It Matters

| Benefit               | Explanation                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Faster delivery**   | No build process or framework overhead — developers start coding instantly |
| **Lower maintenance** | No upgrades or dependencies to patch or refactor                           |
| **Fully accessible**  | Meets WCAG 2.1 AA and Section 508 natively, no add-ons needed              |
| **Security first**    | Minimal JavaScript = smaller attack surface                                |
| **Easier audits**     | Semantic, readable HTML improves transparency and validation               |
| **Lower total cost**  | Smaller files, less tooling, no licenses, easier to scale                  |
