# Customer Overview: Architecture at a Glance

This document is for decision-makers, product owners, and business stakeholders who are interested in what the architecture offers in terms of value, cost control, and future readiness.

---

## What It Is

This is a front-end web architecture designed to reduce project complexity, cost, and delivery time — while improving accessibility, security, and performance.

- It uses only native browser features — no frameworks necessary, no runtime dependencies needed
- Built with HTML (structure), CSS (heuristics), and JavaScript (data)
- Designed for government, accessibility, and security requirements from the ground up

## Why It Matters

| Benefit               | Explanation                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Faster delivery**   | No build process or framework overhead — developers start coding instantly |
| **Lower maintenance** | No upgrades or dependencies to patch or refactor                           |
| **Fully accessible**  | Meets WCAG 2.1 AA and Section 508 natively, no add-ons needed              |
| **Security first**    | Minimal JavaScript = smaller attack surface                                |
| **Easier audits**     | Semantic, readable HTML improves transparency and validation               |
| **Lower total cost**  | Smaller files, less tooling, no licenses, easier to scale                  |

## Key Metrics (Typical Deployment)

- ✅ **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: under 0.12s (typical network conditions)
- ✅ **Total Payload**: < 100 KB
- ✅ **Time to Interactive**: immediate on load
- ✅ **Accessibility**: 100% Lighthouse a11y compliance, no JS required

---

## Compatibility

- Works with any backend (REST, GraphQL, file-based)
- Can run on static hosting or full-stack systems
- Fully compatible with Cloudflare, AWS, and standard CI/CD pipelines

## Common Questions

**Q: Can developers I already have use this?**<br>
Yes. It requires no new tools. All devs familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS can be productive immediately.

**Q: Can this integrate with what we already have?**<br>
Yes. It complements backend frameworks and can wrap around existing APIs or services.

**Q: Is this scalable for future features?**<br>
Yes. It is modular, declarative, and built for growth — without increasing complexity.
