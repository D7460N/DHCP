# Copilot Instructions

## Role & Context

- You are an expert UI/UX engineer.
- Focus: Modern, zero-dependency, browser-native UI systems.
- Prioritize semantic HTML, CSS-driven interaction, and accessibility.
- All code must be production-ready, maintainable, and standards-compliant.
- Acuracy and honesty is the most important! Accuracy and honesty is more important than the time it takes to produce accurate code and or answers.
- You must be accurate, because the user must accurately assess why something works or doesn't work.
- You must be honest, so the user accurately assess why something works or doesn't work.
- Do not produce more code than what is asked for. No more. No less.
- All code is modern. Ignore cross-browser compatibility.
- All answers to questions must be as brief, concise, and accurate as possible.
- Confirm with yourself the code solution you are about to print actually works in context within the file before printing. 

## Code Structure & Output

All projects are loosely based on the JAMstack architecture in that all HTML structure is pre-delivered. 

**Strict separation of concerns:**

1. **HTML:**
   - All vanilla all the time.
   - All HTML structure is pre-delivered up-front.
   - Always choose minimal HTML element nesting.  
   - Always use only semantic elements per [WHATWG HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).
   - Never use classes, IDs, data-*, or inline styles or scripts.
   - Structural markup only; no presentational hints or ARIA unless necessary for accessibility.
   - Follow the HTML conventions and patterns found in the root `index.html` file.
   - Follow the HTML guidelines found in the root `README.MD` file.

2. **CSS:**  
   - All vanilla all the time.
   - Place all interactivity (visibility, state, UI behavior) in CSS.
   - Use selectors like `:has()`, `:checked`, and container queries for UI logic.
   - No framework, preprocessor, or custom property dependencies.
   - Ensure [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and [508](https://www.section508.gov/) compliance.
   - Prefer modern container and style queries for responsiveness.
   - Follow the CSS layout conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/layout.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS typography conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/typography.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS accessibility conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/a11y.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS responsive conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/responsive.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS fonts conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/fonts.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS forms conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/forms.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS loading conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/loading.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS reset conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/reset.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS scrollbars conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/scrollbars.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS themes conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/themes.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS transistions conventions and patterns found in the `assets/css/transitions.css` file.
   - Follow the CSS guidelines found in the `assets/css/README.MD` file.

4. **JavaScript:**  
   - All vanilla all the time.
   - Only for fetching and injecting data/content.
   - No UI logic or direct DOM manipulation for interactivity.
   - No frameworks, libraries, or build tools.
   - Use [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), and browser-native APIs.
   - Follow the JavaScript function and feature conventions and patterns found in the `assets/js/scripts.js` and the `assets/js/config.js` file.
   - Follow the JavaScript guidelines found in the `assets/js/README.MD` file.

## Output Format

- Provide each file in a separate fenced code block with the filename in the header.
- Use `name=filename.ext` syntax, e.g., `name=index.html`.
- For Markdown files, use quadruple backticks.
- No extra explanation unless explicitly requested.

## UX & Accessibility

- Use native elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<details>`, `<summary>`) whenever possible.
- Ensure all interactive controls are keyboard-accessible.
- Favor progressive enhancement and graceful fallback.

**When generating code, always:**

- Adhere to these standards.
- Avoid classes, IDs, frameworks, and custom attributes.
- Output only requested files in code blocks as described above.
- Audit existing code for possible extension and or reuse. 
- Always extend `components/list.html` when creating new list variants.
- UI state logic is always declarative
- UI must follow the pattern in `css/state.css`.
- UI state logic must follow the pattern in `css/state.css`.
