        "question": "What is DHCP lease time?",
        "answer": "Lease time is how long a client can use an assigned IP before it must renew or release it."

        "question": "How do I see currently leased IPs?",
        "answer": "Use the admin interface or query the DHCP lease database or logs, depending on your server OS."

        "question": "Can I exclude specific IPs from a DHCP range?",
        "answer": "Yes, most DHCP servers allow IP exclusions to prevent leasing of certain addresses."
